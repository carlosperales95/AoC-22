# AoC-22

My (late) attempt at resolving each of the ![Advent of Code '22](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

My attempts are be written in JS, to try and polish my FUnctional Programming sklls.
