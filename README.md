# AoC-22

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/day%20ðŸ“…-22-blue)

My (late) attempt at resolving each of the [Advent of Code '22](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

My attempts are be written in JS, to try and polish my *JS Functional Programming skills* (filter, map, reduce, some, every, find...)
I will try using **high-order functions only**, and make the results **as optimized as possible** (the fewer lines the better, without losing too much time over it).

## To run the code for each chalenge
Go into any folder for each of the days (e.g.):
```
cd d1
```

You only need `Node` installed to run the JS files. Run:
```
node solution.js
```

The result to each day's challenge will be logged in terminal. 
If there are more parts to the challenge, both answers will appear in independent lines.

> **Warning**
> Please do not use these to cheat in the AoC'22. These challenges are quite fun to solve by oneself, and you really lose nothing by trying to solve these your way!
